    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Jim: All are passed-by-value

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    team[2] = 'Wrong';


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const teamSlice = players.slice(); // With no parameters, this takes a COPY of the full array.
    teamSlice[2] = 'Slice';

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const teamConcat = [].concat(players);
    teamConcat[2] = 'Concat';

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const teamSpread = [...players];
    teamSpread[2] = 'Spread';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: "Jim",
        age: 105,
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const junior = person;
    junior.name = "Jim Jr.";

    console.log(junior);
    console.log(person); // Crap!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    person.name = "Jim"; // Reset the original

    const correctedJunior = Object.assign({}, person, {name: "Jim Jr"}); // Corrected method of COPYing
    console.log(correctedJunior);
    console.log(person); // Yay!

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread (not yet supported)

    // {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
